    - easier switching back to GTK2

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git:
    - Commit: Amend-option was disabled for merge
    - Log:
        - Commits view: revealing HEAD should always reveal HEAD and not
          stay at working tree node (e.g. double-clicking from Journal)
        - Refresh:
            - log.wt.refreshOpenButUnselectedModels broke refresh of
              commits
            - breaks in case of invalid Bisect configuration (missing
              "start" branch)
- GUI:

      accelerator is cleared by setting another
    - Compare/Merge, Apply Selection: possible internal error if all was
      selected

            - reordering commits did not preserve selection
            - rebase/cherry-pick by drag & drop was broken
            - when filtering, "actually on commit"-marker for refs
              (brighter box) was not properly evaluated
        - Branches view:
            - reveal after Checkout did not work for behind branch with
              "Just Checkout" option
            - checking out a branch should not reset a manually changed
              selection
    - external tools: incorrect parameter "--defaultsVersion" (instead
      of "--version") for "Show Git Version" tool (regression)
    - Working Tree Window, Files view context menu: LFS submenu might
      have been empty (if LFS was not yet installed)
    - macOS: warning about default osxkeychain credential helper
- Hg:
    - possible performance problems with many draft commits in a
      repository with many merges
- startup: possible internal error when specifying invalid value for
  low-level property ui.verboseDate.weekdayFormat
- GUI:

        - Open File Log reuses Branches view selection from repository log
- Repositories view
    - select the current repository only if another repository or group
      was selected before (but, e.g., no subdirectory)

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git
    - Log
        - Refresh: obsolete modified working tree overlaps new commit
          for a short time, then vanishes
    - Git-Flow Light: for various command dialogs "Fetch" options were
      disabled
    - Pull: "Update existing and fetch new tags" did not work for

        - Commits
            - filter broke after changing low-level property
              log.graph.graphicalFiltering in the preferences
            - switching branches lost Working Tree/Index selection
        - File/Subdir log did not remember layout
        - Repositories: state got lost when opening multiple repositories
          at once and having "Show Working Tree & Index Permanently"

      font the same as the default font (instead of a tinier, derived one)

      set ui.textFields.selectAll to false if this is undesired

      locks should always be queried regardless of whether a [lfs] entry

    - disambigued no-name-or-email message
  - Journal & Log:
    - unified "is already pushed" detection
    - remove parenthesis from the displayed author

    pull.queryRemoteLfsLocks to be set to true and
    lfs.<remote>.locksverify=true in the .git/config) - see also
    https://www.syntevo.com/doc/display/SG/Git-LFS
  - Log:
    - Branches view:
      - context actions needed shortcuts
      - enforce the HEAD is selected after performing the initial commit
    - Commits view:
      - added low-level property  log.graph.preserveConnectorsUntilFork

      Journal)
    - several commands should work on multiple selected repositories (as
      in Working Tree window)

    - in rebasing state, the Rebase toolbar button visually clashed with
      the Abort toolbar button
  - Refresh: "renamed modified" state (as in Log)
  - Submodules (Clone, Pull, ...): if selected to initialize new
    submodules, this is done recursively unless the low-level property
    submoduleUpdate.initializeRepository is set to false
- GUI:
  - Add Repository: now tries to add to the most suitable group (the one
    which contains other repositories of this directory)
  - Changes view: changed "Force Text" to "Force Compare" and allowed to

      - didn't refresh for currently selected Working Tree or Index file
      - scrolled to top after any change

        present yet in local repository
      - Compare with Working Tree: showed wrong button texts
      - View Unchanged option was not enabled for commit selection
    - Find Object: did not work in bare repository
    - Refresh: if repository became temporarily invalid, Branches state
      and thus graph became lost

      - opening missing repository did not properly detected missing
        state
      - opening a repository which already was open in a Working Tree

      is set to true, the refs are listed comma-separated, but on new lines
